Sample Project:
#include "antibox/core/antibox.h"

//To create a new project, you'll need to create your own class that derives from antibox::App
class _NAME_ : public App {   

	//A project required four methods:

	void Init() override{} //This will be called before the first frame.
	void Update() override {} //This is called before each frame is rendered.
	void Render() override {} //This is the calls to render each frame.
	void Shutdown() override {} //This is called when the user closes the window.

	//And one optional one:

	void ImguiRender() override {} //This is called to render ImGui.

};

//To run your custom window, you need to create a new method called CreateApp and return a new copy of your window
antibox::App* CreateApp() {
	return new _NAME_();
}








//To edit window properties, use the method GetWindowProperties():
	WindowProperties GetWindowProperties(){
		WindowProperties props;
		ImGuiWindowProperties imgui; //Optional if you want ImGui

		props.w = 1280; //this is width
		props.h = 720; //this is height
		props.title = "Title"; //This is title

		props.imgui.DockingEnabled = true; //If you want to be able to dock your ImGui Windows

		return props; //return because its a method that returns a WindowProperties object
	}
